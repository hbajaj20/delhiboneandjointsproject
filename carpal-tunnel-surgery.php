                        <h2>Carpal Tunnel Surgery</h2>

                        <p class="text-justify pt-3">Dr. Gaurav Rastogi is a renowned orthopedic surgeon specializing in upper extremity surgeries, particularly carpal tunnel surgery. With extensive training and experience, he has established himself as a leading expert in treating carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), a condition that arises from compression of the median nerve in the wrist, leading to pain, numbness, and weakness in the hand.</p><br>

                        <p class="text-justify">Dr. Rastogi employs a comprehensive approach to diagnosing CTS, which often includes a detailed patient history, physical examinations, and diagnostic tests such as nerve conduction studies. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying causes of the condition, which can range from repetitive wrist movements to underlying medical conditions like diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis.</p><br>

                        <p class="text-justify">When conservative treatments such as splinting, physical therapy, or corticosteroid injections fail to relieve symptoms, Dr. Rastogi may recommend carpal tunnel surgery. He utilizes minimally invasive techniques, such as endoscopic carpal tunnel release, which involves making small incisions and using a camera to guide the procedure. This approach not only reduces recovery time but also minimizes scarring and postoperative pain.</p>
