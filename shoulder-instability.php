                        <h2>Shoulder Instability</h2>

                        <p class="text-justify pt-3">Dr. Gaurav Rastogi is a renowned orthopedic surgeon specializing in shoulder instability, a condition characterized by the shoulder joint being prone to dislocations or subluxations. This instability can result from various factors, including trauma, repetitive overhead activities, or inherent joint laxity. Dr. Rastogi emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and tailored treatment plans to restore shoulder function and alleviate pain.</p><br>

                        <p class="text-justify">In his practice, Dr. Rastogi employs advanced diagnostic techniques such as MRI and ultrasound to assess the extent of shoulder instability. He understands that each patient’s situation is unique, and he collaborates closely with them to develop individualized rehabilitation protocols. These may include physical therapy focused on strengthening the rotator cuff and improving shoulder mechanics.</p><br>

                        <p class="text-justify">For cases where conservative treatment fails, Dr. Rastogi is skilled in surgical interventions. He performs arthroscopic surgeries, which are minimally invasive procedures designed to stabilize the shoulder joint by repairing torn ligaments and reconstructing the joint capsule. His expertise in this area not only enhances recovery times but also minimizes post-operative discomfort, allowing patients to return to their daily activities and sports more quickly.</p>
