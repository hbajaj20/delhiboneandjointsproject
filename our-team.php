Being close to them I have learnt a lot about their behaviour and was able to identify their health problems early. Slowly and steadily developed a strong bond and attachment with pets and decided to be a vet to address their sufferings and keep them happy.</p>
                                <p>I have kept various breeds of dogs including Indians, mixed breeds, Spitz, GSD, Golden Retriever, Cocker Spaniel and Poms. Each breed has been fantastic having special peculiarity of their own. I love all of them for their unending attachment to us- the human beings. Today also we have two poms in our family apart from my wife and son.”</p>

Her house always had many pets in the family with most of them being mongrels (our Indies) picked up by her and her brother (who is also a vet) to be taken care of from the neighbourhood. Started by taking care of an injured pup in the garage, moving on to the front porch then to the guest rooms and finally landing in the bed room. Soon her passion turned into the profession and she decided to become a veterinarian. After that she never looked back and moved forward with a single aim to establish multiple dog care centres so that she can serve to a large population of pets.</p>
