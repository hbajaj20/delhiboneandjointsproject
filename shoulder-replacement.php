                        <h2>Shoulder Replacement</h2>

                        <p class="text-justify pt-3">Dr. Gaurav Rastogi is a renowned orthopedic surgeon specializing in shoulder replacement procedures. With years of experience and advanced training, he is recognized for his expertise in treating complex shoulder conditions, including arthritis, rotator cuff injuries, and fractures.</p><br>

                        <p class="text-justify">Shoulder replacement surgery, also known as shoulder arthroplasty, involves replacing damaged portions of the shoulder joint with artificial components. This procedure is often recommended for patients who suffer from severe pain, reduced mobility, and other debilitating symptoms that conservative treatments cannot alleviate. Dr. Rastogi employs a patient-centered approach, assessing each individual's condition through thorough evaluations and advanced imaging techniques.</p><br>

                        <p class="text-justify">During the shoulder replacement procedure, Dr. Rastogi utilizes state-of-the-art techniques to ensure optimal outcomes. He may perform total shoulder replacement, which involves replacing both the ball and socket of the joint, or partial shoulder replacement, where only the damaged parts are replaced. His surgical approach is minimally invasive whenever possible, leading to reduced recovery times and improved postoperative results.</p>
