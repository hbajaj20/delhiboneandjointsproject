                        <p class="text-justify">Wrist surgery can address various conditions, including fractures, ligament injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome, and degenerative diseases like arthritis. Dr. Rastogi’s approach begins with a thorough diagnosis, which includes detailed physical examinations and advanced imaging techniques to ensure a complete understanding of the injury or condition.
