                        <h2>Nerve Compression</h2>

                        <p class="text-justify pt-3">Dr. Gaurav Rastogi is a renowned expert in the field of neurology, particularly known for his contributions to understanding nerve compression disorders. Nerve compression occurs when surrounding structures exert excessive pressure on a nerve, leading to pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the affected area. Conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome, sciatica, and thoracic outlet syndrome are common examples of nerve compression syndromes that Dr. Rastogi frequently diagnoses and treats.</p><br>

                        <p class="text-justify">Through his extensive clinical experience, Dr. Rastogi emphasizes the importance of early detection and intervention in managing nerve compression. He employs a comprehensive approach that includes detailed patient assessments, advanced imaging techniques, and electromyography to accurately diagnose the underlying causes of nerve compression. This holistic understanding allows him to tailor treatment plans that may involve conservative measures, such as physical therapy and medications, or more invasive procedures like nerve decompression surgery when necessary.</p><br>

                        <p class="text-justify">Dr. Rastogi's research also sheds light on the relationship between lifestyle factors and nerve health, advocating for ergonomic practices and regular exercise to prevent nerve compression issues. He often conducts workshops and seminars to educate patients and healthcare professionals about the importance of recognizing early symptoms and the benefits of proactive management.</p>
