                        <h2>Shoulder Dislocation</h2>

                        <p class="text-justify pt-3">Dr. Gaurav Rastogi is a highly regarded orthopedic surgeon specializing in shoulder injuries, particularly shoulder dislocations. Shoulder dislocation is a common orthopedic condition where the upper arm bone, or humerus, slips out of its socket in the shoulder blade. This injury often occurs due to trauma, such as falls or sports-related accidents.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">Dr. Rastogi emphasizes the importance of timely and effective treatment for shoulder dislocations to prevent long-term complications, such as recurrent dislocations or chronic pain. Initially, patients may experience significant pain, swelling, and an inability to move the shoulder. The first step in treatment is typically to reposition the dislocated joint, a process known as reduction. Dr. Rastogi utilizes both manual techniques and, in more complex cases, guided imaging to ensure proper alignment of the shoulder joint.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">Post-reduction, patients often undergo a comprehensive rehabilitation program. Dr. Rastogi designs individualized physical therapy plans to strengthen the shoulder muscles and improve stability, reducing the risk of future dislocations. He also educates patients about activity modifications and preventive strategies, emphasizing the need for gradual return to sports or physical activities.</p>
