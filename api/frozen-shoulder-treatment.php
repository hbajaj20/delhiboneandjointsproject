                        <h2>Expert in Frozen Shoulder Treatment</h2>

                        <p class="text-justify pt-3">Frozen shoulder, medically known as adhesive capsulitis, is a condition characterized by stiffness and pain in the shoulder joint, significantly limiting mobility. Dr. Gaurav Rastogi, a renowned orthopedic specialist, has extensive experience in diagnosing and treating this debilitating condition.</p><br>

                        <p class="text-justify">Dr. Rastogi emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis for frozen shoulder, as prompt treatment can prevent further complications and accelerate recovery. His approach begins with a comprehensive evaluation, including a physical examination and imaging studies, to assess the extent of the condition. Based on the findings, he tailors a treatment plan that suits each patient’s unique needs.</p><br>

                        <p class="text-justify">Treatment methods employed by Dr. Rastogi range from conservative to advanced interventions. Initially, he recommends a combination of physical therapy and medication to alleviate pain and improve shoulder mobility. Physical therapy plays a crucial role, involving targeted exercises that gradually restore range of motion and strengthen the shoulder muscles.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify mt-4">For patients who do not respond to conservative measures, Dr. Rastogi may suggest corticosteroid injections to reduce inflammation and pain. In more severe cases, he might consider minimally invasive surgical options such as arthroscopic release, which aims to free the tight tissue surrounding the shoulder joint.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">Dr. Rastogi is committed to educating his patients about frozen shoulder and its treatment options. He believes that understanding the condition empowers patients, helping them make informed decisions about their health. With his expertise and compassionate approach, Dr. Gaurav Rastogi has helped numerous patients regain their shoulder function and return to their daily activities, enhancing their quality of life.
