                        <h2>Bankart Repair</h2>

                        <p class="text-justify pt-3">Dr. Gaurav Rastogi is a renowned orthopedic surgeon specializing in shoulder surgery, particularly in the field of Bankart repair. This surgical procedure is crucial for individuals suffering from shoulder dislocations and instability, which can significantly impact their quality of life and athletic performance.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">The Bankart repair procedure addresses a specific type of shoulder injury where the labrum—a ring of cartilage that surrounds the shoulder socket—becomes detached due to trauma. This detachment often leads to recurrent shoulder dislocations, making daily activities and sports challenging. Dr. Rastogi employs advanced surgical techniques to reattach the labrum to the glenoid (the socket part of the shoulder joint) securely.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">Dr. Rastogi's approach to Bankart repair is characterized by a combination of minimally invasive arthroscopic techniques and personalized patient care. By utilizing arthroscopy, he can perform the surgery through small incisions, resulting in less tissue damage, reduced pain, and quicker recovery times compared to traditional open surgery. His expertise in the latest surgical innovations allows him to provide patients with effective treatment options tailored to their specific needs.</p>
