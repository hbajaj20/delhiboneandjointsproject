                        <h2>Ankle Fracture: Insights from Dr. Gaurav Rastogi</h2>

                        <p class="text-justify pt-3">Ankle fractures are common injuries that can occur due to various factors, including falls, sports injuries, or car accidents. Dr. Gaurav Rastogi, an esteemed orthopedic surgeon, emphasizes the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment to ensure optimal recovery and restore functionality to the ankle.</p><br>

                        <p class="text-justify">An ankle fracture involves a break in one or more of the bones that form the ankle joint, typically the tibia, fibula, or talus. Symptoms often include severe pain, swelling, bruising, and difficulty bearing weight on the affected foot. Dr. Rastogi advises patients to seek medical attention immediately if they experience these symptoms, as early intervention is crucial for preventing complications.</p><br>

                        <p class="text-justify">Diagnosis typically involves a physical examination and imaging studies such as X-rays or MRI scans to determine the extent of the injury. Treatment options depend on the severity of the fracture. For non-displaced fractures, conservative management such as rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) may suffice, along with immobilization in a cast or boot. However, displaced fractures may require surgical intervention to realign the bones and secure them with plates, screws, or pins.</p>

Physical therapy is often recommended to restore strength and mobility to the ankle. Patients are encouraged to adhere to their rehabilitation programs to achieve the best outcomes.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">In conclusion, Dr. Gaurav Rastogi's expertise in managing ankle fractures underscores the importance of timely diagnosis and personalized treatment plans.
