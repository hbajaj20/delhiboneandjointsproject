                        <h2>Rotator Cuff Repair</h2>

                        <p class="text-justify pt-3">Dr. Gaurav Rastogi is a renowned orthopedic surgeon specializing in shoulder surgery, particularly in rotator cuff repair. The rotator cuff, a group of muscles and tendons that stabilize the shoulder joint, plays a crucial role in shoulder mobility and strength. Injuries to the rotator cuff can lead to pain, weakness, and limited range of motion, significantly impacting a patient's quality of life.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">Dr. Rastogi's approach to rotator cuff repair emphasizes both surgical precision and patient-centered care. He employs advanced techniques such as arthroscopic surgery, which is minimally invasive and allows for quicker recovery times compared to traditional open surgery. This method reduces postoperative pain and minimizes scarring, enabling patients to resume their daily activities more swiftly.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">In addition to his surgical expertise, Dr. Rastogi is committed to educating his patients about their conditions and treatment options. He believes that informed patients are better equipped to make decisions about their health care. During consultations, he takes the time to explain the mechanics of the rotator cuff, the nature of the injury, and the various surgical and non-surgical options available, including physical therapy and medication management.</p>
