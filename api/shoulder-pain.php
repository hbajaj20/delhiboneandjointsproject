                        <h2>Shoulder Pain and Dr. Gaurav Rastogi's Expertise</h2>

                        <p class="text-justify pt-3">Shoulder pain is a common ailment that can significantly impact daily activities and overall quality of life. It can arise from various causes, including injuries, overuse, arthritis, or underlying medical conditions. Dr. Gaurav Rastogi, a renowned orthopedic specialist, is dedicated to diagnosing and treating shoulder pain through a comprehensive approach tailored to each patient's needs.</p><br>

                        <p class="text-justify">Patients often present with symptoms such as pain during movement, stiffness, swelling, or reduced range of motion. Dr. Rastogi emphasizes the importance of a thorough evaluation, which may include physical examinations, imaging studies like X-rays or MRIs, and functional assessments. This meticulous approach helps identify the specific cause of shoulder pain, whether it be rotator cuff tears, tendinitis, bursitis, or frozen shoulder.</p><br>

                        <p class="text-justify">Treatment options provided by Dr. Rastogi are varied and may include conservative methods such as physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, and lifestyle modifications aimed at reducing strain on the shoulder joint. For more severe cases, he may recommend interventional procedures, including corticosteroid injections or arthroscopic surgery, to alleviate pain and restore function.</p>
